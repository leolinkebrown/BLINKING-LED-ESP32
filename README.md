### Code Explanation

Firstly, the pin for the LED is defined as 13 and set as the output, meaning instead of receiving a signal, it outputs one. Then, on a loop, the LED is turned on and off with delays of 1 second inbetween. When the LED is turned on or off, a message is sent to the serial monitor dictating if it was turned on or off.
